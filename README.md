How to Use Derpking11's ChestGUI Datapack
---
Use
/funtion chestgui:aaa/item {item:"",command:"",targetPos:[]}
---
-the item will be the well.. item.
-the command value is the command to be ran when a player uses it
-the targetpos is an array of cordiantes of the chest that should be put into frame next
---
if you hold a lime concrete block in your main hand, you will not get cleared of the items
this can be changed at chestgui:zzz/next_screen lines 33-36 in the datapack
